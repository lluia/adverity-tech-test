# `<Dialog />`

## Summary üí≠

The aim of this proposal is to illustrate the possible interface for a **Dialog component** in React ‚öõ flexible enough to suit different use cases.

## Basic example üìì

<BasicExample />

```tsx
import { Dialog, Button } from "./components";
// ...
<Dialog isOpen={visible} onClose={closeDialog} aria-label="Delete user">
  <Dialog.Trigger onClick={openDialog}>Delete user</Dialog.Trigger>
  <Dialog.Header title="Delete user?" onClose={closeDialog} />
  <Dialog.Content>
    This will permanently delete John Doe. This action cannot be undone.
  </Dialog.Content>
  <Dialog.Footer>
    <Button
      size="small"
      variant="error"
      onClick={() => {
        window.alert("User John Doe was deleted.");
        closeDialog();
      }}
    >
      Delete user
    </Button>
  </Dialog.Footer>
</Dialog>;
```

## Motivation ‚òïÔ∏è

We want to have a `<Dialog />` component that can be customized to serve different content for different use-cases like:

- _editing a document_
- _warning before applying some changes_
- _contacting support_
- _deleting an entity_

<ComplexExample />

We also want to able to trigger the dialog from different types of elements (buttons, links, etc...) and from multiple locations within a single page.

## Detailed design üìê

This new dialog component should:

- **have explicit open/close state**
  - _open/close state will need to be managed outside of the component_
- **be agnostic on child structure**
  - _leveraging [dot notation](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html#using-dot-notation-for-jsx-type) to let consumers decide what to render_
- **be agnostic on the trigger component**
  - _we should not assume any shape/type for the dialog trigger_
- **be accessible**
  - _making sure it adheres [to WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#dialog_modal) as much as possible_
- **be portal first**
  - _leveraging [React Portals](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html) the dialog will mount at the root we designate, to prevent issues with `z-index` overlaps amongst others_

We should be able to render the dialog with/without a header/footer:

```tsx
// without header and footer
<Dialog isOpen={true}>
  <Dialog.Content>
    <span>Hello world</span>
  </Dialog.Content>
</Dialog>
```

```tsx
// with a header
<Dialog isOpen={true}>
  {/* if `onClose` wasn't supplied the 'x' button won't render */}
  <Dialog.Header onClose={toggleDialog}>Greet user</Dialog.Header>
  <Dialog.Content>
    <span>Hello world</span>
  </Dialog.Content>
</Dialog>
```

```tsx
// with a footer
<Dialog isOpen={true}>
  <Dialog.Content>
    <span>Hello world</span>
  </Dialog.Content>
  <Dialog.Footer>
    <Button>OK</Button>
  </Dialog.Footer>
</Dialog>
```

### Setup

As a pre-requesite, we need to render its root next to the application component tree root:

```tsx
import { Dialog } from './components'

export function App() {
  return (
    <Router />
    <Dialog.Root />
  )
}
```

This ensures that the **portal entry point** for the dialog is available and the dialog knows where to render itself. You can read more about [React Portals](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html) here.

We render the dialog on a portal to prevent `z-index` overlaps amongst other issues.

### Keyboard navigation

According to [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#dialog_modal), when opening the dialog, its first section should be on focus.

When pressing `TAB`, focus should should move to the next **dialog section**, pressing `TAB + SHIFT` should move focus to the previous **dialog section**.

Pressing `ESC` should close the dialog.

Pressing `ENTER` or `SPACE` when the element that triggers the dialog is focused should open the dialog.

All this focus management should be handled internally by the component, the user of the dialog should not need to declare any props to manage this.

### State management

All state management is handled by the component rendering the dialog. The dialog open state is controlled though the `<Dialog isOpen />` prop:

```tsx
function MyComponent() {
  const [isOpen, toggleOpen] = React.useState(false);
  const toggleDialog = () => toggleOpen((s) => !s);
  const onApply = () => {
    window.alert("changes applied");
    toggleDialog();
  };

  return (
    <>
      <Dialog isOpen={isOpen} onClose={closeDialog}>
        <Dialog.Trigger as={Button} onClick={toggleDialog}>
          Open Dialog
        </Dialog.Trigger>
        <Dialog.Header onClose={toggleDialog}>Edit datastream</Dialog.Header>
        <Dialog.Content>foo</Dialog.Content>
        <Dialog.Footer>
          <Button onClick={onApply}>Apply</Button>
        </Dialog.Footer>
      </Dialog>
    </>
  );
}
```

This provides a lot of flexbility given the dialog can be open / closed in different situations without the need for the `<Dialog />` to know explicitly which child caused to close it.

There's three main ways to close the dialog:

1. _pressing on the overlay behind the dialog_
2. _pressing on the 'x' button of the dialog header_
3. _pressing 'ESC' when the dialog is open_

`<Dialog onClose />` will take care of **1.** and **3.** while `<Dialog.Header onClose />` will take care of **2.**.

### Accessibility

`<Dialog />` should implement all the relevant [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#dialog_modal) roles and labels to adhere to the specification without the need for the user, as much as possible, to assign manually HTML ARIA attributes.

‚ö†Ô∏è &nbsp;It's important to use `<Dialog.Trigger />` to render the dialog disclosure. You can pass any component to it:

```tsx
  <Dialog.Trigger as={Link} onClick={openDialog}>
    Link
  </Dialog.Trigger>
  <Dialog.Trigger as="button" onClick={openDialog}>
    Plain button
  </Dialog.Trigger>
  <Dialog.Trigger as={SecondaryButton} onClick={openDialog}>
    Secondary button
  </Dialog.Trigger>
```

Using `<Dialog.Trigger />` ensures that the relation between the dialog disclosure and the dialog component is marked correctly via ARIA attributes for assistive devices.

## Drawbacks üëª

Implementing a fully accessible and customizable `<Dialog />` component is not an easy task. Instead of writing our own and having to maintain the logic we could build on top of [Reakit#Dialog](https://reakit.io/docs/dialog/) or [ReactUI#Dialog](https://reach.tech/dialog/) which are un-opinionated on styling but would take away the burden of accessibility from us.

## Alternatives ‚§¥

As mentioned, we can use [Reakit#Dialog](https://reakit.io/docs/dialog/) or [ReactUI#Dialog](https://reach.tech/dialog/) and apply our own styling, just wrapping them in our library. However, this approach would make us force to sync major releases of our library with theirs when applying updates.

## Adoption strategy ‚öôÔ∏è

Adoption strategy should be pretty straightforward and users should be able to use it straightaway without conflicting with other dialog components.

We could make an accessibility expert QA our implementation to make sure it's easy to navigate with assistive technology despite our tests.

The dialog should play well in both desktop and mobile devices as it's been built taking small viewports into consideration.

## How we teach this üßµ

This repository shows examples of using this component in isolation with all its possible variations. The tests as well should document how to use the component. We can pair-program with users of this component when trying to implement it and gather feedback on its API and behavior.

## Unresolved questions ‚ùì

None for now.
