import { Dialog, Button, ExampleBlock } from "../";

# `<Dialog />`

## Summary üí≠

The aim of this proposal is to illustrate the possible interface for a **Dialog component** in React ‚öõ flexible enough to suit different use cases.

## Basic example üìì

<ExampleBlock>
  <Button>Open Dialog</Button>
</ExampleBlock>

```tsx
import { Dialog, Button } from './components'

<Dialog.Trigger as={Button}>Open Dialog</Dialog.Trigger>
// ...
<Dialog isOpen={true}>
  <Dialog.Header
    title="Delete User?"
    onClose={close}
  />
  <Dialog.Content>
    <Text>This will permanently remove John Doe, are you sure?</Text>
  </Dialog.Content>
  <Dialog.Footer>
    <ActionButtons>
      <Button variant="secondary">Cancel</Button>
      <Button>Delete</Button>
    </ActionButtons>
  </Dialog.Footer>
</Dialog>
```

## Motivation ‚òïÔ∏è

The idea is to have a `<Dialog />` component that can be customized to server different use cases.

Any content can be served within the dialog, on top of that, the title can be customized as well as whether the close `X` option appears or not.

Both the **header** and the **footer** can be optionally rendered.

The contents of the **footer** can be customized as well.

The idea is that this dialog is flexible enough to suit different use-cases like:

- _editing a document_
- _warning before applying some changes_
- _contacting support_
- _deleting an entity_
