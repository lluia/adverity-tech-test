# `<Dialog />`

## Summary üí≠

The aim of this proposal is to illustrate the possible interface for a **Dialog component** in React ‚öõ flexible enough to suit different use cases.

## Basic example üìì

<BasicExample />

```tsx
import { Dialog, Button } from './components'

<Dialog.Trigger as={Button}>Open Dialog</Dialog.Trigger>
// ...
<Dialog isOpen={true}>
  <Dialog.Header
    title="Delete User?"
    onClose={close}
  />
  <Dialog.Content>
    <Text>This will permanently remove John Doe, are you sure?</Text>
  </Dialog.Content>
  <Dialog.Footer>
    <ActionButtons>
      <Button variant="secondary">Cancel</Button>
      <Button>Delete</Button>
    </ActionButtons>
  </Dialog.Footer>
</Dialog>
```

## Motivation ‚òïÔ∏è

The idea is to have a `<Dialog />` component that can be customized to server different use cases.

Any content can be served within the dialog, on top of that, the title can be customized as well as whether the close `X` option appears or not.

Both the **header** and the **footer** can be optionally rendered.

The contents of the **footer** can be customized as well.

The idea is that this dialog is flexible enough to suit different use-cases like:

- _editing a document_
- _warning before applying some changes_
- _contacting support_
- _deleting an entity_

## Detailed design üìê

This new Dialog component should be:

- **uncontrolled component**
  - _open/close state will need to be managed outside of the component_
- **agnostic on child structure**
  - _leveraging [dot notation](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html#using-dot-notation-for-jsx-type) to let consumers decide what to render_
- **agnostic on trigger component**
  - _we should not assume any shape/type for the dialog trigger_
- **accessible**
  - _making sure it adheres [to WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#dialog_modal) as much as possible_
- **portal first**
  - _leveraging [React Portals](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html) the dialog will mount at the root of the `<body>` in the HTML, no matter where it's rendered in the React tree to prevent issues with overlays and `z-index`_
