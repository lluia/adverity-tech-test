## Running locally ðŸ”–

Alternatively you can run the application locally.

Before you start, you will need:

- [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/)
- [Yarn Package Manager](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

Once ready, install all the dependencies:

```
$ yarn
```

And run both the API and Development server:

```bash
$ yarn start
```

From there, you can open the app by visiting [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000/) on your browser.

You can run the components tests like so:
